CSU Machine Learning 2015 project - entering the Kaggle competition "How much did it rain? II"

To use this code, download the train and test data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-much-did-it-rain-ii/data and unzip them into this folder. Then, process them using master_processing.py - in a python prompt, import it, then use the processor function. Many of our scripts depend on a file named average.csv in this directory, with the default values of the program. Others rely on a nomissing.csv - this can be created using the writestats function in the stats.py script in the BasicAnalysis folder.

The different folders represent different approaches we took to the problem.
